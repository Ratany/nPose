This is a fork of Howard Baxtons nPose repo.

All files are in a project directory which can be used with the build
system that can be found in https://github.com/Ratany/lsl-repo

The files in the src directory are symlinks to the originals because
odd file names were used.

The nPose directory containing the original files is a git repo by
itself, cloned from https://github.com/HowardBaxton/nPose


The nPose scripts are licensed under the GPLv2
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt), with the following
addendum:

The nPose scripts are free to be copied, modified, and
redistributed, subject to the following conditions:

   - If you distribute the nPose scripts, you must leave them full
     perms.

   - If you modify the nPose scripts and distribute the
     modifications, you must also make your modifications full
     perms.

"Full perms" means having the modify, copy, and transfer
permissions enabled in Second Life and/or other virtual world
platforms derived from Second Life (such as OpenSim).  If the
platform should allow more fine-grained permissions, then "full
perms" will mean the most permissive possible set of permissions
allowed by the platform.
